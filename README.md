# CASH BALANCE PROCESS
## The Challenge
The cash balance process is totally manual and a part of the process regarding recurring bills not paid takes the analyst most of the time. The analyst has to check all outstanding transactions (bills not paid) to get their total amount and to put them in the cash balance sheet.
## The Solution
A web application was developed to retrieve the amount of not paid bills and the details of bills as such, given a date range. Itâ€™s straightforward to use the web app. The outcome will be displayed on the screen by pasting the link of the google-sheet URL of the transactions that users want to check, and selecting the start and end date.
