# CASH BALANCE PROCESS
## The Challenge
The cash balance process is totally manual and a part of the process regarding recurring bills not paid takes the analyst most of the time. The analyst has to check all outstanding transactions (bills not paid) to get their total amount and to put them in the cash balance sheet.
## The Solution
An application was created to retrieve the amount of not paid bills and these bills as such, given a date range. Itâ€™s straightforward to use the web app. The outcome will be displayed on the screen pasting the link of the URL sheet of the transactions that someone wants to check and picking up the start and end date
